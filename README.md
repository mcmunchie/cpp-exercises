# C++ Exercises
Learning C++ programming language. Practice with statements and functions, data types and variables, classes and objects, references and pointers, files and arrays, character and string manipulations, lambda functions, overloading and inheritance, and basic object-oriented programming. Experimented with various compilers MSVC, Clang llvm, and Mingw (GCC) using Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio Build Tools.

> Note: some labs may not work as intended but are examples of object-oriented programming in the C++ language.
